Then, features are sequentially removed based on their significance, with the least predictive feature being removed and a new model being fitted with the remaining features at each step. This process continues until the model's performance starts to decline or until some termination condition is met. To perform the backward feature selection, one can use SFS function from `mlxtend` library with appropriate arguments (e.g., set 'forward' to False).\n",
